I took this class 25 fall with prof James A Sethian.
He's a nice professor but is also notorious for not giving out practice exams.

Someone sent me some very blurry images of his 2021 final and so I cleaned it up and feel free to print it out.

The reason the textbook says "cut" is because it's original size exceeds 100mb, and requires Git LFS, which I don't really understand how to setup. But that's more than you need already anyways~
